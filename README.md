# Prism
> In optics, a prism is a transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that refract light. A dispersive prism can be used to break light up into its constituent spectral colors. Furthermore, prisms can be used to reflect light, or to split light into components with different polarizations.

Prism is Akka reactive project that received data streams using REST API and split and distribute the streams inside Apache Kafka. Like a real prism, it also can reflect the stream if the authentication against Postgres isn't valid.
